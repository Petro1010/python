We discussed before that non-linear data can be solved with cross features. However, when the data gets more complex, this may not be effective.

To model a nonlinear problem, we can directly introduce a nonlinearity. We can pass our hidden node values into nonlinear function (Activation function)

Common Activation functions include:
 - Sigmoid which converts weighted sum to value between 0 and 1
 - Relu function makes the output of every x value 0
