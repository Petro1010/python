Mapping Raw Data to Features:
- feature vector, which is the set of floating-point values comprising the examples in your data set. 
- Feature engineering means transforming raw data into a feature vector.

Mapping Categorical Values:
- discrete set of possible values
- Ex. Street Name

One-hot encoding:
- For values that apply to the example, set corresponding vector elements to 1.
- Set all other elements to 0.
- effectively creates a boolean array

Quality of Good Features:
- Avoid rarely used discrete feature values (want feature with repeating values)
- Clear and obvious meanings (clearly named and value makes sense)
- Do not mix magic values with actual data (no nulls or -1 in place of an actual value), instead use a boolean feature to mark if other feature is valid or not
- definition of feature does not change over time

Cleaning the data:
- Scaling: reducing very large values to a standard range
- Handling extreme outliers: use logarithmic scales, ignore all outlier values
- Binning: transform values that do not follow specfic trends into different bins
- Scrubbing: getting rid of bad examples
- Know your data set
