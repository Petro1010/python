What is Supervised Machine Learning?
- create models that combines inputs to produce useful predictions

- Label: variable that we are predicting (y, our output)
- Features: input variables describing our data (x1..xn, our input)
- Labeled example: has both a feature and label (data we provide). We use this to train our model
- unlabeled example: only has a feature but unknown label (data given to us). Model should be able to predict the label.
- Model: maps examples to predicted data. Training is how you show the model labled examples and allow it to learn relationships between features and label. Inference means applying the trained model to unlabeled examples.
- Regression Model: predicts continuous values (the value or probability of something for example)
- Classification Model: predicts discrete values (choose from a pool of options)
