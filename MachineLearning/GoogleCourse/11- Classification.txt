Logistic regression returns a probability. You can use the returned probability "as is" (for example, the probability that the user will click on this ad is 0.00023) or convert the returned probability to a binary value (for example, this email is spam).

In order to map a logistic regression value to a binary category, you must define a classification threshold (also called the decision threshold). Everything above the threshold belongs to one category and everything below a threshold belongs to another category.

A true positive is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the positive class. Similarly, a true negative is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class.

A false positive is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class. And a false negative is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class.

Accuracy is one metric for evaluating classification models. Informally, accuracy is the fraction of predictions our model got right. 

Precision attempts to answer the following question:
What proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?

Recall attempts to answer the following question:
What proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?
