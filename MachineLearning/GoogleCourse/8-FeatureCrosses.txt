Solving non-linear problems:
- sometimes a problem can not be solved by using a linear model
- In this case, we can create a feature cross
- feature cross: synthetic feature that encodes nonlinearity in the feature space by multiplying two or more input features together.
- new cross feature x3 = x1x2, results in new formula y = b + w1x1 + w2x2 + w3x3
- cross features can be done through the multiplication of any number of features
- Cross features of one-hot feature vectors. The cross of 2 strings for examples will be str1 and str2. Ex. (country:USA and language:spanish)
- linear learners usually scale well to massive data, so feature crosses allow us to create more complex models while still remaining linear


Different cities in California have markedly different housing prices. Suppose you must create a model to predict housing prices. Which of the following sets of features or feature crosses could learn city-specific relationships between roomsPerPerson and housing price?

One feature cross: [binned latitude X binned longitude X binned roomsPerPerson]
Crossing binned latitude with binned longitude enables the model to learn city-specific effects of roomsPerPerson. Binning prevents a change in latitude producing the same result as a change in longitude. Depending on the granularity of the bins, this feature cross could learn city-specific or neighborhood-specific or even block-specific effects.
